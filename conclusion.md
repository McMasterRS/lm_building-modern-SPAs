# Conclusion

Throughout this learning module, we learned the basics of styling Material UI components using the McMaster Digital Brand Standards as an example of a consistent theme. We also covered the basics of mobile user interface design and we learned how to evaluate a website for AODA compliance using the Wave tool. You created a single-page application using Next.js and MUI that contains the following UI elements and features:
- A custom favicon
- Styled text using the `Typography` component
- A theme that uses the McMaster Heritage Maroon and Heritage Gold colors
- A styled responsive navigation bar with two configurations depending on the screen size
-  A responsive footer that adapts its layout and position to the device's screen size
- Support for dark and light mode (in addition to following the user preference)
- Breadcrumbs with a styled universal back button
- Styled buttons using a custom `MacButton` component
- A styled speed dial component
- A styled file input widget
- A styled dropdown menu
- Vertical tabs that make use of a drawer on mobile devices
- AODA compliance

While we only scratched the surface of what you can do with Next.js and Material UI, we hope that this learning module provided you with the basic knowledge needed to create modern and responsive websites. 

We recommend the following resources if you want to learn more about Next.js, Material UI, the McMaster Brand Standards, and the web accessibility guidelines:
- [The Official Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [The Official MUI Documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/)
- [McMaster Brand Standards](https://brand.mcmaster.ca/)
- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0 (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)

You can also use the [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) tool to assess your website in terms of performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO score. The tool can grade the mobile and desktop versions of your website. Please note that your website needs to be web accessible without the need for a VPN connection or login credentials for this tool to work. Alternatively, you can use the [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) tool that is built into the Google Chrome browser to assess any website that requires logging in using credentials.
