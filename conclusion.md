Throughout this workshop, we learned the basics of styling Material UI components to conform to the McMaster Digital Brand Standards. You created a website using Next.js and MUI that contains the following UI elements and features:
- Stylized text using the `Typography` component
- A responsive navigation bar with stylized buttons and icon buttons
- A persistent footer
- Support for dark and light mode (in addition to following the user preference)
- Breadcrumbs with a stylized universal back button
- Stylized buttons
- A stylized file input widget
- A stylized dropdown menu
- AODA compliance

While we only scratched the surface of what you can do with Next.js and Material UI, we hope that this workshop provided you with the basic knowledge needed create your McMaster-branded website.
