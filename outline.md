## Goal of this workshop

The goal of this workshop is to learn how to style **some** MUI components using the McMaster Digital Branding Guidelines. You will not be an expert on MUI by the end of the class and this is okay. We want to cover the basics of MUI styling, but as with any skill, mastering it takes practice.

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this workshop, attendees will be able to:

- Create a Next JS application
- Add the MUI library to a Next JS application
- Use the recommended McMaster typography fonts and styles
- Create navigation elements for your webpage including a navigation bar, breadcrumbs and a universal back button.
- Style common interactive UI elements like buttons and file input widgets
- Display information to the user using MUI cards and/or a data grid
